# Daanvir
It was my aim to found a startup that tracks "needs" related to hunger, poverty, gender-inequality and those related to other sustainable goals. I called this platform daanvir, where we were attempting to bring a collaboration between various NGO's and stratups working in this field, such as Feeding India. The basic idea was to track needs on realtime using live campaigns  having a set of goals, a timeline feature to let people know what is happening in their area and how they can contribute. We would profile them based on charity they have given. Thus, we would bring a revolution in humanity by changing the fundamentals of social interactions. Now, when they open our website, they can see red flags that mark the area of impact and the needs in that area, they could ask ola driver to get that route and deliver some old articles or any help at the "Daanvir'sanctioned teastalls, where our teammembers would visit every week or as per need basis and deliver the essentials to those who need. However, this model failed as we had not enough funds to carry out this big idea.

The updated version of the code is not open source.
